# Consultation & Medical Advice Policy

## Our Role: Sales, Not Medical

Ashandy Cosmetics is a **retail business**, not a dermatology clinic.

Our AI assistant can help you with:
- ✅ Finding products in our inventory
- ✅ Explaining product ingredients and benefits
- ✅ Recommending products based on general skin types (oily, dry, combination)
- ✅ Processing orders and payments
- ✅ Tracking deliveries

## What We Cannot Do

### No Skin Diagnosis
We **cannot** diagnose skin conditions or diseases:
- ❌ "What's this rash on my skin?"
- ❌ "Do I have eczema or psoriasis?"
- ❌ "Is this acne or an allergic reaction?"

### No Medical Prescriptions
We **cannot** prescribe treatments:
- ❌ "What cream will cure my acne?"
- ❌ "Can you recommend something for my skin infection?"
- ❌ "What should I use for this wound?"

### Why This Matters
- Your health is too important for guesswork
- Wrong product recommendations could worsen conditions
- Only qualified professionals should diagnose skin issues
